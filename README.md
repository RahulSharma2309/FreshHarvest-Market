# FreshHarvest Market - Organic Food Marketplace

A comprehensive microservices-based organic food marketplace built with .NET 10, demonstrating modern software architecture patterns, best practices, and scalable design.

## 🚀 Quick Start

> **📖 For detailed step-by-step instructions, see [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md)**

### Fastest Start (VS Code Tasks)

**Recommended: Use VS Code Tasks**
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type "Tasks: Run Task"
3. Select "Docker: Build & Start All Services"

This will clean, build, and start all services automatically.

### Manual Setup

#### Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** (or Docker Engine + Docker Compose)
- **Git** (for cloning)
- **GitHub Account** (for Personal Access Token - optional for now)

#### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd FreshHarvest-Market
   ```

2. **Build Docker images**

   ```bash
   cd infra
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. **Start all services**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
   - **API Gateway**: http://localhost:5000
   - **Swagger Docs**: http://localhost:5001/swagger (Auth), http://localhost:5005/swagger (User), etc.

## 🛠️ Development

### Running Services Locally

Each service can be run independently:

```bash
cd services/user-service
dotnet run
```

### Running with Docker

```bash
cd infra
docker-compose up -d          # Start all services
docker-compose logs -f         # View logs
docker-compose down            # Stop all services
```

### VS Code Tasks

Use VS Code tasks for common operations:

- **Ctrl+Shift+P** → "Tasks: Run Task"
- Available tasks:
  - `Docker: Start All Services`
  - `Docker: Stop All Services`
  - `Docker: Build All Services`
  - Individual service tasks

## 🔐 GitHub Token Setup

The services require a GitHub Personal Access Token to access the `Ep.Platform` NuGet package.

**Quick Setup:**

```powershell
cd infra
.\setup-env.ps1
```

The `.env` file created by the setup script will be automatically used by Docker Compose on every build, so you only need to set it up once per machine.

**Manual Setup:**

1. Copy `infra/.env.example` to `infra/.env`
2. Edit `infra/.env` and add your GitHub token
3. Docker Compose will automatically use it

See [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md) for complete step-by-step instructions.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Microservices**: Independent, scalable services
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point with routing
- **N-tier Architecture**: Abstraction, Core, API layers
- **Platform Library**: Shared infrastructure via NuGet
- **Docker**: Containerized services for easy deployment
- **SQL Server**: Database per service pattern
